# ByteCode - Byte Code represents the fixed set of instruction created by python developers representing all the type of operations like arithmetic operations, comparison operations, memory related operation etc.
# Python Compiler = A Python compiler coverts the program source code into byte code.
# Type of Python Compilers:
    # CPython - default download and installation from the website to PC (standard)
    # Jpython/Jython - if python need to use in javaPlatform then we will use this
    # PyPy - 
    # IronPython - this for dotnet framework
    # Rubypython - for Ruby
    # StacklessPython
    # Pythonxy
    # AnacondaPython

# Write Source Code / Program
# Compile the Program using Python Compiler
# Compiler Converts the Python Program into byte Code
# Computer/Machine can not understand Byte Code so we convert it into Machine Code using PVM
# PVM uses an interpreter which understands the byte code and convert it into machine code 
# Machine code instructions are then executed by the processor and results are displayed
